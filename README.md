# CPCBidding

In this repository, CPC Bidding task is implemented. 

    CPC Bidding (Cost-per-click) is a charging metric for (booking, advertisement, etc.) websites. 
    
In this project, a booking website's 90 days of data is preprocessed, analysed and a forecasting model is proposed. Lastly, the model's performance is evaluated. 

A detailed report can be found in [here](REPORT.md).
